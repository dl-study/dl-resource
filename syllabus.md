# Theory
* Study the course **Neural Networks for Machine Learning** by Prof. Hinton on Coursera
  * https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks
* The real schedule may be different from that of the course. Particularly, we may study the contents of 2 or 3 weeks from the course in 1 week.

# Practice
1. Basically, use Keras & Theano to solve the exercises & quizzes from Prof. Hinton course
2. Refer to source code from DeepLearning.net Tutorial
  * http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/contents.html
3. Practice with **Deep Learning With Python** book by Jason Brownlee from machinelearningmastery (TensorFlow and Theano with Keras)
	* https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-with-python/
