# Theory
* Study the course "Neural Networks for Machine Learning" by Prof. Hinton on Coursera
  * https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks

# Practice
1. Basically, use Keras & Theano to solve the exercises & quizzes from Prof. Hinton course
2. Refer to source code from DeepLearning Tutorial
  * http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/contents.html
3. Practice with "Deep Learning With Python" book by Jason Brownlee from machinelearningmastery (TensorFlow and Theano with Keras)
